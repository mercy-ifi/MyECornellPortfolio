# MyECornellPortfolio  

This repository documents my projects, exercises, and resources from the **Break Through Tech AI Fellowship (2025–2026)**. It highlights weekly labs, capstone work, and experiments that connect academic learning to real-world applications in machine learning and data science.  

## Tech Stack  
- Python 3.11+  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
- Git & GitHub for version control  

## Contents  

### Lab 1  
- Formulated a machine learning problem through business understanding and problem definition  
- Worked with NumPy arrays  
- Manipulated pandas DataFrames  

### Lab 2  
- Explored data understanding and preparation  
- Performed one-hot encoding for feature transformation  
- Analyzed feature–label relationships  
- Identified further steps needed for full modeling readiness  

### Lab 3  
- Compared Decision Trees (DTs) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs)  
- Trained and evaluated multiple DT and KNN classifiers  
- Determined the best-performing model  

### Lab 4  
- Implemented a logistic regression class from scratch in Python  
- Trained a logistic regression classifier using the custom class  
- Benchmarked against scikit-learn’s logistic regression  

### Lab 5  
- Conducted model selection for logistic regression  
- Used grid search cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning  

### Lab 6  
- Trained and compared regression models: Linear Regression and Decision Trees  
- Trained and compared ensemble models: Gradient Boosted Trees and Random Forests  
- Visualized and compared model performance metrics  

### Lab 7  
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras  
- Trained the CNN on image data  
- Evaluated model performance  

### Lab 8 (Final Project)  
- Selected the **Census Income dataset (censusdata.csv)** to predict whether an individual’s income exceeds a threshold  
- Performed data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Trained, evaluated, and selected models to optimize performance
